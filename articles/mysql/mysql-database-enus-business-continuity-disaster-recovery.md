# MySQL on Azure service continuity solutions

This article summarizes a number of typical interruption events and corresponding solutions to protect service continuity with MySQL on Azure. It also introduces some key specific steps and indicators for recovering from regional disasters.

## Overview ##
Service continuity refers to the flexible design, deployment, and execution of applications to avoid applications being either temporarily or permanently unable to perform their service functions as a result of planned or unplanned interruption events. Unplanned interruption events include human error, temporary or permanent interruptions, and even regional disasters (which may cause a specific Azure region to suffer a large-scale loss of functionality). Planned events include redeploying applications in different regions and upgrading applications. The goal of service continuity is to reduce the effect of interruptions on application services and minimize the duration of the effects to avoid data loss.

Before we look at service continuity solutions, it is important to be familiar with the following concepts:

* Recovery time objective (RTO): The maximum acceptable time after an interruption incident occurs before the application fully recovers. RTO is used to measure the maximum availability loss during the outage.
* Recovery point objective (RPO): The maximum amount of last updates (time interval) the application can lose by the moment it fully recovers after the disruptive event. RPO measures the maximum loss of data during the failures.
* Estimated recovery time (ERT): The estimated length of time after a restore or failover request is sent before the database is fully available.

## Service continuity solutions ##
Following are common scenarios and corresponding solutions.

## Recover from a regional disaster ##

MySQL on Azure now provides offsite recovery features to help you maintain service continuity when regional disasters occur. Examples of a regional disaster might be the loss of power or a fire in a large area of computer rooms, an earthquake, or other unanticipated events.

### There are currently two solution types for disaster recovery: ###
 
* When regional outage, MySQL PaaS team will analyze the root cause of the outage, if the outage duration will be longer than RPO, MySQL PaaS level failover will be implemented (in a shorter time than the RPO). If it is not possible to perform a quick restore, MySQL on Azure will perform an offsite database restore on all affected instances. The point in time to be restored will be the closest possible restore point to the time at which the fault occurred.

* Self-service disaster recovery: If you are using a production environment with higher requirements in terms of recovery times, you can use the PowerShell command line to manually restore the affected instances offsite when a disaster occurs.


### The principle of offsite recovery: ###
When incidents happen, user can either rely on self-service by specifying the point in time he wants to restore, or reply on PaaS level failover, which will specify the incident time point by default, MySQL on Azure will restore the time point with best effort. MySQL on Azure stores users data in Azure page blob with Read-Access Geographically Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) to maintain 3 intra-region data copy and 3 cross-region data copy. When user initiates geo restore, if storage in source location remain intact during incidents, MySQL on Azure will based on the time point user specified to copy data from source location to target location, and then restore MySQL server instance; if storage in source location is damaged, MySQL on Azure will restore the closest time point based on Azure storage geo redundant data copy in target location, and then restore MySQL server instance.

### Offsite recovery performance indicators: ###
ERT<3 hours，RPO< 1 hour. <br>
>[AZURE.NOTE] ERT, RTO, and RPO are project indicators that are intended only for reference purposes. These indicators only appear in regional disasters and are not part of the MySQL database service’s service level agreement (SLA).

### User self-service process: ###
If a disaster occurs and you can use the Azure portal, you can use the offsite restore process in [backup and restore](/documentation/articles/mysql-database-point-in-time-restore/) to perform the operation. However, if regional disasters occur frequently, it will not be possible to obtain correct information on the instance in the Azure portal. In such a situation, we recommend that you perform an offsite restore operation on the instance by using PowerShell:

```
New-AzureRmResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.MySql/servers" -ResourceName <ResourceName> -ApiVersion 2015-09-01 -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Location <TargetLocation> -SkuObject @{name=<targetSKU>} -Properties @{creationSource=@{server='<SourceServerName>';region='<SourceLocation>';timepoint='<TimeTag>'};version = '<version number>'}
```

>[AZURE.NOTE] 
1. Timepoint is an optional value. If you do not enter this value, the default is the current point in time. If you want to enter this value, you must use the date-time format in JSON, for example, 2016-05-06T08:00:00. We use UTC time universally.<br>
2. Instances that were created by using the Azure portal will be allocated to the “Default-MySQL-ChinaNorth” and “Default-MySQL-ChinaEast” resource groups by default on the basis of geographic location.

After the restored instance has been created, you need to add the current IP to the firewall whitelist for the new instance. You will also need to manually update the connection strings for the applications and database with the hostname of the new instance to restore the application-layer services.

## Common service continuity problems ##
1. Is restoring from offsite copies supported?<br> Only offsite recovery is currently supported. We do not currently support offsite replication functions; that is, restoration from offsite copies is not supported.
