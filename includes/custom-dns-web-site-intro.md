When you create a web site, Windows Azure provides a friendly subdomain on the chinacloudsites.cn domain so your users can access your web site using a URL like http://&lt;mysite&gt;.chinacloudsites.cn. You can also associate a custom domain name, such as contoso.com, with your web site in order to provide a more recognizable domain name for your users.
