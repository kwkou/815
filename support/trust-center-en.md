Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet is a separate instance of Microsoft's Azure platform located in mainland China and independently operated and sold by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of [Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co.](http://www.en.21vianet.com/), Ltd. It is based on the same Azure technology that powers Microsoft's global cloud service with comparable service levels to customers.

As a customer of Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet, you get:

* A cloud service hosted in data centers exclusively in mainland China and operated independently by 21Vianet, a leading Chinese Internet data center provider.

## Security and privacy are embedded into the development of Azure

Security and privacy is made a priority at every step, from code development through incident response.

The design of Azure is dominated by security from the ground up. We build security into software code following an approach known as the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). Mandatory development process embeds security requirements into the entire software lifecycle, from planning through deployment. To help ensure that operational activities follow the same security priorities, we’ve developed rigorous security guidelines laid out in the Security Management process.

## Security: We keep your customer data safe

Azure employs a robust set of security technologies and practices. These help ensure that Azure infrastructure is resilient to attack, safeguards user access to the Azure environment, and helps keep customer data secure through encrypted communications as well as threat management and mitigation practices, including regular penetration testing.

Managing and controlling identity and user access to your environments, data, and applications by federating user identities to Azure Active Directory and enabling multi-factor authentication for more secure sign-in.

**Encrypting communications and operation processes.** For data in transit, Azure uses industry-standard transport protocols between user devices and 21Vianet datacenters, and within datacenters themselves. For data at rest, Azure offers a wide range of encryption capabilities up to AES-256, giving you the flexibility to choose the solution that best meets your needs.

**Securing networks.** Azure provides the infrastructure necessary to securely connect virtual machines to one another and to connect on-premises datacenters with Azure VMs. Azure blocks unauthorized traffic to and within 21Vianet datacenters, using a variety of technologies. Azure Virtual Network extends your on-premises network to the cloud through site-to-site VPN.

**Managing threats.** To protect against online threats, Azure offers Microsoft Antimalware for cloud services and virtual machines. Azure also employs intrusion detection, denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention, regular penetration testing, and data analytics and machine learning tools to help mitigate threats to the Azure platform.

## Privacy and Control: You own and control your data

We strive to be transparent in our privacy practices, offer you meaningful privacy choices, and responsibly manage the data we store and process

**You own your own data.** Customer Data is all the data, including all text, sound, software or image files that you provide, or are provided on your behalf, to us through your use of the services. You can access your customer data at any time and for any reason without assistance from 21Vianet. 21Vianet will not use customer data or derive information from it for advertising or data mining.

**You are in control of your data.** Because the customer data you host on Azure belongs to you, you have control over where it is stored and how it is securely accessed and deleted.

**What happens if law enforcement or another third party asks 21Vianet for Customer Data?** 21Vianet believes that its customers should control their own information whether stored on their premises or in a cloud service. Accordingly, we will not disclose Customer Data to a third party ( excluding our suppliers and subcontractors ) except as you direct or as required by applicable law and regulations. If compelled to disclose Customer Data to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited. Should a third party contact us with a complaint about your use of the Services (for example, allegation of infringement by you or your End User), we may ask the third party to contact you directly and may provide your basic contact information to the third party.

## Compliance: Our services are in line with global /domestic standards

Azure meets the international and industry-specific compliance standards ISO/IEC 27001 as well as country-specific standards like Information System Security Multi-Level Protection Scheme Certification (MLPS) and Trusted Cloud Service (TCS). As part of our commitment to transparency, you can verify our implementation of many security controls by requesting audit results from the certifying third parties.

## Transparency: You know how your data is stored and accessed, and how we help secure it

Azure is built on the premise that for you to control your own customer data in the cloud, you require visibility into that data. You must know where it is stored. You must also know, through clearly stated and readily available policies and procedures, how we help secure your customer data, who can access it, and under what circumstances. And you can review the third-party audits and certifications.

## Shared Responsibility

Our Chinese customers are subject to many different laws and regulations that may vary from location to location and industry to industry. To help our customers comply with their own requirements, we build our services with common privacy and security requirements in mind. However, it is ultimately up to our customers to evaluate our offerings against their own requirements, so they can determine if our services satisfy their regulatory needs. We are committed to providing our customers with detailed information about our cloud services to help them make their own regulatory assessments.

A cloud platform like Azure requires shared responsibility between the customer and the service provider. 21Vianet is responsible for the platform based on technology provided by Microsoft and seeks to provide a cloud service that can meet the security, privacy, and compliance needs of our customers. Customers are responsible for their environment once the service has been provisioned, including their applications, data content, virtual machines, access credentials, and compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to their particular industry and locale.
