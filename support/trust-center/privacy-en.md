Privacy is an integral part of our product and service lifecycle. We work to be transparent in our privacy practices, offer customers meaningful privacy choices, and manage responsibly the data we store.

The [Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet Privacy Statement](/support/legal/privacy-statement/) describes the specific privacy policy and practices that govern customers' use of Azure .

## Customer Data and Other Data Types

**Customer Data** is all the data, including all text, sound, software or image files that you provide, or are provided on your behalf, to us through your use of the services. For example, Customer Data includes data that you upload for storage or processing in the services and applications that you or your end users upload for hosting in the services. It does not include configuration, technical settings, or support ticket information.

**Administrator Data** is the information about administrators (including account contact and subscription administrators) provided during sign-up, purchase, or administration of the services, such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.

**Metadata** includes configuration and technical settings and information. For example, it includes the disk configuration settings for an Azure Virtual Machine or database design for an Azure SQL Database.

**Access Control Data** is used to manage access to other types of data or functions within Azure. It includes passwords, security certificates, and other authentication-related data.

## You own your own data

With Azure, you are the owner of your customer data. You can access your customer data at any time and for any reason without assistance from 21Vianet. 21Vianet will use your customer data only to provide the services agreed upon, including purposes that are compatible with providing those services. We will not use customer data or derive information from it for advertising.

We give you authenticated and logged access to your customer data, and restrict access to it by 21Vianet personnel and subcontractors. We also take strong steps to protect your customer data from inappropriate use or loss, and to segregate your customer data on shared hardware from that of other customers.

**21Vianet does not use Customer Data for advertising.** We will use Customer Data only to provide you the Services. This use may include troubleshooting to prevent, find and fix problems with the operation of the Services. It may also include improving features for finding and protecting against threats to users. We will not use Customer Data or derive information from it for any advertising or other commercial purposes without your consent.

**You control who has access to your Customer Data.** Strong authentication, including the use of multi-factor authentication, helps limit access to customer data to authorized personnel only. Sample audits are performed by both 21Vianet and third parties to attest that access is only for appropriate business purposes. When access is granted, it is carefully controlled and logged, and revoked as soon as it is no longer needed.

The operational processes and controls that govern access and use of customer data in Azure are rigorously maintained and regularly verified by accredited audit firms.

**21Vianet use logical isolation to segregate each customer's data from that of others.** Azure is a multi-tenant service, meaning that the deployments and virtual machines of many customers are stored on the same physical hardware. When the data from many customers is stored at a shared physical location, Azure segregates customer data to protect it from inappropriate use or loss while rigorously preventing customers from gaining access to one another's data. Additional safeguards include proper controls for administrative access.

21Vianet provides simple, transparent data-use policies and obtain independent audits. 21Vianet provides you with details of our data protection policies and practices in clear, straightforward language in our 21Vianet Online Services Privacy Statement.

Every year, we undergo third-party audits by internationally recognized auditors as an independent validation that we comply with our privacy policies and procedures. These document how we meet our security and compliance objectives, and, when shared with you, serve as a practical mechanism to validate our promises.

**21Vianet's subcontractors are contractually obligated to meet our privacy requirements.** Azure may use subcontractors to perform certain support services. 21Vianet holds our subcontractors to security and privacy standards equivalent to our own. Our subcontractors only handle your data when required to provide or maintain the services.

Subcontractors are prohibited from using your data for any other purpose, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Subcontractors that work in facilities or on equipment controlled by 21Vianet must follow our privacy standards. All other subcontractors must follow privacy standards equivalent to our own.

## You are in control of your data

Because the customer data you host on Azure belongs to you, you have control over where it is stored and how it is securely transferred and deleted.

**You may delete your Customer Data at any time.** If you ever choose to delete data or leave the service, 21Vianet follows stringent standards that call for removing your customer data from all systems under its control, and physically destroying decommissioned hardware.

As part of our agreements for cloud services such as Azure Storage, Azure VMs, and Azure Active Directory, we contractually commit to specific processes for the deletion of data and the destruction of storage hardware when a customer requests it or leaves the service.

**Data deletion.** Data deletion techniques vary depending on the type of data being destroyed—whether subscriptions, storage, virtual machines, or databases. In Azure, we are careful to ensure that one customer's data is not allowed to leak into the data of another customer. We also make sure that when a customer deletes data, no other customer can access that data.

You may extract and/or delete Customer Data at any time. When you terminate a Subscription or it expires it, we will retain any Customer Data you have not deleted for at least ninety (90) days so that you may extract it, except for Limited Offerings, where we may delete Customer Data immediately without any retention period. You remain responsible for all storage and other applicable charges during this retention period. Following the expiration of this retention period, we will delete all Customer Data, including any cached or back-up copies, after the end of the retention period. You agree that we have no additional obligation to continue to hold, export or return Customer Data and that we have no liability whatsoever for deletion of Customer Data pursuant to these terms.

* In Azure Storage, all disk writes are sequential. Deleted data remains on disk until the sequential writes reach the end of the disk and the system has to start writing over deleted data. This applies to virtual machines as well, although the virtualization mechanism is designed to ensure that those spots on the disk cannot be read by another customer until data is written again, thus avoiding the threat of data leakage.
* The Azure SQL database implementation is designed to help protect user data from leakage by disallowing all access to the underlying storage except through the SQL database application programming interface (API), which allows a user to read, write, and delete data, but does not support the reading of data not written by the user.

**Data retention.** You may extract and/or delete Customer Data at any time. When you terminate a Subscription or it expires it, we will retain any Customer Data you have not deleted for at least ninety (90) days so that you may extract it, except for Limited Offerings. Following the expiration of this retention period, we will delete all Customer Data, including any cached or back-up copies, after the end of the retention period.

**Destruction of physical storage devices.** When disk drives used for storage suffer a hardware failure, they are securely erased before 21Vianet returns them to the manufacturer for replacement or repair. All of the data on the drive is completely overwritten to ensure that the data cannot be recovered by any means. When disk drives are decommissioned, they are destroyed according to the corresponding standard.

## How 21Vianet responds to law enforcement or another third party asks 21Vianet for Customer Data.

21Vianet believes that its customers should control their own information whether stored on their premises or in a cloud service. Accordingly, we will not disclose Customer Data to a third party (excluding our suppliers and subcontractors) except as you direct or as required by applicable law and regulations. If compelled to disclose Customer Data to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited. Should a third party contact us with a complaint about your use of the Services (for example, allegation of infringement by you or your End User), we may ask the third party to contact you directly and may provide your basic contact information to the third party.

## Location of Customer Data

21Vianet operates Microsoft Azure in data centers located exclusively in mainland China.

Customers may specify the region(s) of the datacenters in which Customer Data will be stored. Available regions are shown below.

|REGION|
|---|
|China (East) (located in Shanghai)|
|China (North) (located in Beijing)|

* We may transfer Customer Data between regions for data redundancy or other purposes. For example, Azure replicates Blob and Table data between two regions within China for enhanced data durability in case of a major data center disaster.
Our suppliers (including Microsoft, which provides the Azure technology on which our service runs) do not have logical or physical access to Customer Data. In limited circumstances, we may authorize a supplier to access systems containing Customer Data when necessary to help troubleshoot a customer support incident or address technical issues. We will grant such access only for the duration necessary to resolve the issue. We carefully monitor the access given and terminate the access when the issue is resolved.
* We do not control or limit the regions from which customers or their end users may access Customer Data.
